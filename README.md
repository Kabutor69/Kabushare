idk man it just shared files ok?
u upload stuff, u get a link, u send link.
files die after 48h. dont ask me why 48, i just picked it.

## how to run
1. `npm i`
2. fix ur `.env` (MONGODB_URI='ur key')
3. `npm run dev`

built with nextjs and mongo (i haavent the comments in most of files so u have to read the code urself lol).

gl to me and yall seeing this.
